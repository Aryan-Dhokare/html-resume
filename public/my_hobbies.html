<h1>My hobbies</h1>

<p>Outside of academics, I am deeply interested in sports and actively engage in them as a part of my extracurricular pursuits, valuing the teamwork and discipline they foster. I am also intrigued by the world of coding, constantly exploring new technologies and refining my programming skills through hands-on practice. In addition to my technical interests, I have a unique passion for the art of bonsai cultivation, which teaches me patience, attention to detail, and the value of nurturing long-term growthâ€”qualities I strive to bring into all aspects of my life.</p>
